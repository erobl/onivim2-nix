# onivim2-nix
A nix package for onivim2 from an appimage

To be able to build the package you have to include the appimage you either 
built yourself or bought from onivim.io. I won't be including it as you need a
license for it.

To add it to your nix store either add it to your own nixpkgs or include
the file on your packages.
